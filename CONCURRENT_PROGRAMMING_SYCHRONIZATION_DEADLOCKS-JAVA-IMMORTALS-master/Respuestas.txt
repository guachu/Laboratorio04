Part I:

1. Execute and check how the program works, Execute jVisualVM and inspect the CPU use of the corresponding process.

	- What is the reason of this CPU consumption?
		La razon por la cual el consumo de CPU es tan alto se debe a que en la clase productor esta tomando tiempo de espera activo
	- What is the class responsable of that consumption?
		La clase responsable es el productor
		Imagen 1
2. Write some code in order to solve the CPU's use problems, 
having in mind  that for now the production is slow and the consumption is fast, check that the CPU consumption has decreased.

3. Make a producer that produces as fast as it can, and the consumer consumes slow,
 keeping in mind that the producer knows a Stock limit (how many elements have to have at most in the queue)
 your code has to respect that limit.Check the Collection API used as queue in order to validate that the limit not be exceeded.
 Verify that when you set a small limit in the stock, there is not a high CPU consumption or errors. So that,
 altogether we are exploring the total of servers

Part II:

2.Check the code and identify how the indicated funcionality was implemented. 
Given the purpose of the game, an invariant should be that the sum of the life points of all the players always be the same.
(Of course, in a moment of time when an operation of increase / reduction of time is not in process). 
For that case, for N players, what should be that value?
	A: Ya que la salud por defecto de cada jugador es 100, el valor total de la salud debe ser 100*N.

3.Run the application and verify how the "pause and check" option works, is the invariant satisfied?
	A: No se satisface, aumenta el número con el tiempo.
