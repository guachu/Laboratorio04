Part I:

1. Execute and check how the program works, Execute jVisualVM and inspect the CPU use of the corresponding process.

	- What is the reason of this CPU consumption?
		La razon por la cual el consumo de CPU es tan alto se debe a que en la clase productor esta tomando tiempo de espera activo
	- What is the class responsable of that consumption?
		La clase responsable es el productor

2. Write some code in order to solve the CPU's use problems, 
having in mind  that for now the production is slow and the consumption is fast, check that the CPU consumption has decreased.

3. Make a producer that produces as fast as it can, and the consumer consumes slow,
 keeping in mind that the producer knows a Stock limit (how many elements have to have at most in the queue)
 your code has to respect that limit.Check the Collection API used as queue in order to validate that the limit not be exceeded.
 Verify that when you set a small limit in the stock, there is not a high CPU consumption or errors. So that,
 altogether we are exploring the total of servers
